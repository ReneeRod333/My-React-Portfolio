# My-React-Portfolio

  ## Description

I created a portfolio using Vite and React, which made the development process smooth and efficient. Vite's fast build times and hot module replacement enhanced my workflow, allowing me to focus on designing a responsive and dynamic user interface with React. I enjoyed the flexibility React provided in building reusable components, making the portfolio not only visually appealing but also highly functional.
